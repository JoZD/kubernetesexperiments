kubectl ponints (re-directs) at the Kube-api server
it gets the data from the etctd cluster and replies back 


The aapi server creates a pod object, without assiging to a node, this is doing by checking the api server regularly
The scheduler checks that there is a new pod not assigned, then, it checks which node should be assigned with the pod, and this is stored
in the etctd server >> this is then sent to the kubelet on the worker node, and the container is created with the image engine 
once done, the kubelet updates the api server, and the server saves the status in the etctd server
