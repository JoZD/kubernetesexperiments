ETCTD 

Key-value store 

In K8s it stores info about:

Nodes
Pods
Configs
Secrets
Accounts
ROles
Bindings
Others


Every info gathered from kubectl get .. it's from the ETCD server, every change made to the cluster is stored in etcd

--advertise-client-urls https://$interlalp:2379  >> This is the adress where etcd listens 

The Api server is the one that communicates with etcd 


Note: kubeadm deploys etcd as a pod 

To get all keys run #etcdctl get / --prefix -keys-only

In k8s the root directory is called "Registry" inside of it it can be found:
minions
pods
replicasets
deployments
roles
secrets 

Note: In high available envs, where multiple master nodes are present, muiltiple etcd will be, they need to communicate with each other
